# GoFlow: Golang Concurrency Debugger and Visualizer

## Project Overview

### Objective
Create a sophisticated tool for debugging and visualizing Goroutines and channels in real-time, making concurrency debugging intuitive for Go developers.

### Key Outcomes
- Real-time visualization of Goroutine lifecycles
- Deep insights into channel communications
- Detection of concurrency issues (deadlocks, race conditions, bottlenecks)
- IDE integration support (VS Code, Goland)

## Core Features

### 1. Goroutine Debugging
- Active Goroutine monitoring and state tracking
  - Running state
  - Blocked state
  - Waiting state
- Synchronization primitive analysis
- Parent-child relationship visualization
- Long-running Goroutine detection

### 2. Channel Visualization
- Real-time channel activity monitoring
  - Message flow tracking
  - Buffer utilization metrics
  - Blocked sender/receiver detection
- Channel lifecycle management
  - Unclosed channel detection
  - Resource leak prevention

### 3. Visualization Dashboard
- Interactive UI components:
  - Goroutine timeline visualization
  - Dependency graph rendering
  - Resource contention heatmaps
- Advanced filtering capabilities
  - State-based filtering
  - Performance-based filtering

### 4. Concurrency Issue Detection
- Automated detection systems:
  - Deadlock identification
  - Race condition analysis
  - Circular wait detection

### 5. Performance Profiling
- Integration with pprof:
  - CPU usage tracking
  - Memory allocation analysis
  - Goroutine execution metrics
- Statistical analysis:
  - Goroutine count tracking
  - Channel throughput measurement
  - Performance bottleneck identification

### 6. Session Management
- Data export capabilities
- Interactive playback functionality
- Step-by-step analysis tools
